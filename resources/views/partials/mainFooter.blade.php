        <h3>About Us</h3>
        DO we have enough content here for several links to internal pages? Or perhaps just a paragraph of text.  If we don't have much perhaps we should consider using something else in this spot.

        <h3>Get Started</h3>
        I think we should have a link here to a "tell us about you" form that will allow potential clients to give us some information about themselves and it can email to the appropriate person on the team depending on what they are looking for.
